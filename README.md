BF4 Intel
=========================

Ever wondered what your gaming sessions would look like if you had access to all the information you need right there in-front of you, without the need to alt-tab nor move from that comfortable couch of yours? Here's the solution!
BF4 Intel is your most trusted companion on the Battlefield regardless of the platform you're playing on, or how many people you have in your party. Currently you can view your statistics, unlocks, assignments and awards, plus the added feature to view the latest Battlelog news! 

Most people have their phones next to them while playing, making this the ultimate app for all of you gamers out there - you won't need to have your laptop switched on as a console player, just for the sake of Battlelog. You don't need to alt-tab the game to look up your current unlocks, and miss important in-game opportunities. Just open the app, check what you need and play your best rounds ever.
